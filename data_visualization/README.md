# Industrial Strength Visualization: Data Storytelling Using Python Visualization Libraries

Data visualization provides a pictoral representation of your data. It provides more imformation to what you think your data contains. 

In real-life data visualization is an important process to data analysis, which involves story telling and recommendations. 

In this practical, we will be looking at a real-world data on `2020 World Population by Countries`, to gather as much information and write out our findings/insights.

The visualization tools used are [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)


## Setup:
- Clone this repo (or update your previously cloned repo)
- Go through the notebook to try your hands on the codes.
- While doing that, you may realise that there are some details that weren't explored and that'll be awesome. So get at them!


## Task

- Read to understand this Customers [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wholesale+customers).
- Get creative with your data exploration using the visualization tools you are familiar with.
- Each team is required to write a single blog using the data, visualizations and findings.
- The blog link will be submitted for review. You could use [Medium](https://medium.com/) for your writing.
